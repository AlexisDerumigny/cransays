<p>Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in an <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf">article from the R Journal</a> as well as in <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf">another article from the same journal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>inspect</strong>: this is your first submission or the automated tests found an error that requires human review.</li>
<li>
<strong>newbies</strong>: a specific queue for the manual inspection of first time CRAN submissions.</li>
<li>
<strong>pending</strong>: the CRAN maintainers are waiting for an action on your side. You should check your emails!</li>
<li>
<strong>waiting</strong>: packages for which the CRAN team waits for an answer from the maintainer.</li>
<li>
<strong>pretest</strong>: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still here.</li>
<li>
<strong>recheck</strong>: your package seems ready for publication. This step checks whether reverse dependencies will still work after the update.</li>
<li>
<strong>publish</strong>: youâ€™re all set! Your package has passed the review process and will soon be available on CRAN.</li>
</ul>
